                   ****Cricket Rules*****
The Game: Cricket is played between two teams. The goal is to score more 
points then the opposing team. Each team alternates between offense and 
defense. In the implementation of cricket, we are using the rules of
twenty20 cricket.

Teams: Each team has 12 players per team. Only eleven players play on the
field any even given time, the twelth person being the substitute for any 
injured player. 

The Field: Cricket is played on a elliptical field. Batting occurs on 
the pitch where two batters from the offensive side take turns trying
to hit the ball and score runs. The boundary of the field is the outfield
wall.

Rules: Twenty20 Cricket is a shorter from of cricket that spans two
innings. Each team is given the opportunity to bat. It is a shorter 
form of Test cricket which can take multiple days to complete. On offense 
two batters take turns trying to hit a ball that is bowled by the opposing
teams bowler. When the ball is hit the two batter run between the pitch
crossing back and forth to score points. This continues until the 
batter has faced a total of 6 balls bowled or he his dismissed and called
out. Each team continues batting and tries to score runs until they have
10 of their 11 batters dismissed or they have reached 20 overs.
