                     **** The Rules of Baseball ****
The Game: Played between two teams. Each teams goal is to score more points
    than the opposing team. Each team alternates between offense and defense

Teams: Each team has 9 players who actively play the game. On offense the 
    one person bats at a time. On defense there are the outfielders: Right
    field, Center Field, and Left Field; the infielders: First Baseman
    Second Baseman, Third Baseman, and Shortstop. The Pitcher and Catcher
    complete the fielding positions. 
    
    There are also players that do not play on the field. The bench players
    who fill in for injuries and fatigue and the bullpen who replace pitchers

The Field: The game is played on a field enclosed by two perpendicular foul
    lines and an outfield fence. The infield is a square separated by 90 foot
    bases(first base, second base, third base, and home), the goal is for
    players to run all the way around the bases without being called out.
    The outfield is beyond the bases.

Rules: The game is played in 9 innings unless the game is still tied.
    Each team getting its opportunity to hit. The away team bats first. Teams
    can only score when playing offense. The hitters goal is to advance as
    many bases as possible by hitting the ball into the field. If the ball 
    is hit out of the field, the player may run the bases freely and score.
    A player is called out if the ball is caught before touching the ground
    or the ball reaches the base before they are able to run to the base.

    The game is over if the home team scores more than the away team by the 
    end of the away teams opportunity to bat in the 9th inning or the home
    team scores the tie-breaking run in the 9th inning or later. The away team
    wins if they are able to score more than the home team and keep their lead
    after the home teams opportunity to hit in the 9th inning or later.
